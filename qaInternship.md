                    Defect_ID - Unique identification number for the defect.
                    Defect Description - Detailed description of the Defect including information about the module in which Defect was found.
                    Version - Version of the application in which defect was found.
                    Steps - Detailed steps along with screenshots with which the developer can reproduce the defects.
                    Reference - where in you Provide reference to the documents like: requirements, design, architecture.
                    Detected By - Name/ID of the tester who raised the defect
                    Status - Priority and severity
* Ad-hoc testing, exploratory testing; types of testing >> staging, production, localhost			
* Regression testing			
* Why testing >> https://www.guru99.com/software-testing-introduction-importance.html ;	https://www.guru99.com/test-case.html	
* Testing Life Cycle >> 
                          Requirement Analysis - analysing the requirement
                          Test Planning - resources and time estimation
                          Test case development - analysing and evaluating scenarios based on communication with all integrated teams
                          Test Environment setup - to do smoke test
                          Test Execution - executing test cases bug reporting
                          Test Cycle closure - evidencing testing conclusions >> https://www.guru99.com/software-testing-life-cycle.html		
* Api testing	>>
                  Return value based on input condition: it is relatively easy to test, as input can be defined and results can be authenticated
                  Does not return anything: When there is no return value, a behavior of API on the system to be checked
                  Trigger some other API/event/interrupt: If an output of an API triggers some event or interrupt, then those events and interrupt listeners should be tracked
                  Update data structure: Updating data structure will have some outcome or effect on the system, and that should be authenticated
                  Modify certain resources: If API call modifies some resources then it should be validated by accessing respective resources >> https://www.guru99.com/api-testing.html
