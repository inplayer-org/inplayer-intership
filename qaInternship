                    Defect_ID - Unique identification number for the defect.
                    Defect Description - Detailed description of the Defect including information about the module in which Defect was found.
                    Version - Version of the application in which defect was found.
                    Steps - Detailed steps along with screenshots with which the developer can reproduce the defects.
                    Reference-  where in you Provide reference to the documents like . requirements, design, architecture or maybe even screenshots of the error   to help understand the defect
                    Detected By - Name/ID of the tester who raised the defect

                          Requirement Analysis - analysing the requirement
                          Test Planning - resources and time estimation
                          Test case development - analysing and evaluating scenarios based on communication with all integrated teams
                          Test Environment setup - to do smoke test
                          Test Execution - executing test cases bug reporting

6	/ Api testing	>>
                  Return value based on input condition: it is relatively easy to test, as input can be defined and results can be authenticated
                  Does not return anything: When there is no return value, a behavior of API on the system to be checked
                  Trigger some other API/event/interrupt: If an output of an API triggers some event or interrupt, then those events and interrupt listeners should be tracked
                  Update data structure: Updating data structure will have some outcome or effect on the system, and that should be authenticated
                  Modify certain resources: If API call modifies some resources then it should be validated by accessing respective resources >> https://www.guru99.com/api-testing.html
